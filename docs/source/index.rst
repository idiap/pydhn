PyDHN
=================================

**PyDHN** is a Python library for storing, visualizing and managing District Heating Network (DHN) data, running simulations and automate I/O workflow, built on top of `Networkx <https://networkx.org/>`_. The main idea behind PyDHN is to provide a modular, object-oriented framework which prioritizes versatility.

With PyDHN you can run both steady-state and dynamic simulations, test different control strategies and implement your own components with few lines of code.
